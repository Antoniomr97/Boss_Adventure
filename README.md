## pip install pygame
Right above this text, you’ll find the command to install the Pygame library, which I’m using as the foundation for developing my first game in Python. With the installation complete, I can now run the main.py file to test and track the progress of the project. I’m excited to share my updates and see how this project takes shape. I hope the final result will be impressive!
